This proyect has the objetive to be a little base to create API REST with NodeJs with Loopback V3
and to be the proyect to get skills with git.



This is the route that I followed:
- git init
- npm init
- (Create .gitignore)
- npm install loopback-cli
- npx lb -v
- npx lb

- cd (folderName)
-- node .
